	<h1>Diffusion CDC API. <br>
	</h1>This package provides an easy to use adapter for listening for changing tables in informix via a CDC connection.</h1>

<p><b>Use of this package is deprecated</b><p/>

<p><b>CDC</b> (Change data capture) is a an API exposed by Informix
(IBM) which allows the immediate notification of database table changes.
The Change Data Capture API starts capturing transactions from the
current logical log and processes all transactions sequentially. The
first time you start capturing data for a particular table, data capture
starts at the current log position. If you later stop capture and then
restart it, you can restart at the point in the logical logs where data
capture was stopped. You cannot go backwards in time through the logical
logs to capture the history of the table or perform random seeking in
the logical logs.</p>
