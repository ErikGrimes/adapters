Google Cloud 2 Device Messaging Services
========================================

Provides a simple means of integrating with Google Cloud 2 Device Messaging Services.

Using the C2DM adapter
----------------------

1. Obtain the C2DM connection
   The connection to the APNS servers is over an HTTPS connection. The connection configuration
   is held in the Diffusionâ„¢ configuration file PushNotification.xml.
   
   The configuration is constucted as follows:

<table>
  <tr>
    <td>name</td>
    <td>Symbolic name used to locate this connection from the adapter.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>email</td>
    <td>An email address registered with Google for C2DM</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>password</td>
    <td>The password related to the above email address</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>collapse</td>
    <td>Optional collapse-key used by C2DM servers to conflate C2DM messages</td>
  </tr>
</table>

  Java developers wishing to send C2DM messages via the adapter must first obtain a connection
  to the C2DM servers with the following code:

    C2DMServerConnection cnx = C2DMAdapter.getNamedConnection( definitionName );

  This will place a connection (or reuse an existing connection).
  
2. Writing apps to receive C2DM messages
   Google hosts [documentation on writing C2DM aware applications](http://code.google.com/android/c2dm/#writing_apps)
   
3. Composing the message
   Messages sent via C2DM comprise a dictionary of named values. Some values are reserved for
   C2DM transmission purposes and are provided automatically by the C2DM adapter. Google
   recommends prefixing solution specific values with data. to disambiguate.
   
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>Reserved key values</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>registration_id</td>
    <td>The registration ID retrieved from the Android application on the phone. Required.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>collapse_key</td>
    <td>An arbitrary string that is used to collapse a group of like messages when the device is
    offline, so that only the last message gets sent to the client. This is intended to avoid
    sending too many messages to the phone when it comes back online. Note that since there is no
    guarantee of the order in which messages get sent, the "last" message may not actually be the
    last message sent by the application server. Required.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>delay_while_idle</td>
    <td>If included, indicates that the message should not be sent immediately if the device is
    idle. The server will wait for the device to become active, and then only the last message
    for each collapse_key value will be sent. Optional.</td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Authorization</td>
    <td>Header with a ClientLogin Auth token. The cookie must be associated with the c2dm
    service. Required.</td>
  </tr>
</table>
